Here's a sample file that includes: the master schedule (the starting pattern of shift for each staff), their availability, and their approved leaves. This is in relation to the Schedule Preparation use case.

Theoretically, the steps are this:
agent overlays the leaves onto the master schedule to 'remove' the shifts on those days
agent evaluates the staffing levels vs targets as a whole
Agent able to conduct conversation with each staff member to say "here's what we have, here are the areas of problem/opportunity, strategically elicit more availability on shifts where the unit's overall staffing is challenged, confirm any details" and get their sign off on these inputs.
Agent reviews with manager once inputs are in. More details in below thread.
Agent assembles inputs into optimization format.
Optimization runs, potentially producing multiple feasible solutions.
Agent can summarize and discuss solutions with manager and identify final schedule for posting.
